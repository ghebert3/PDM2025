# Reaction Game Documentation

- Name: Arduino-p5.js Reaction Game  
- Goal: Test players’ reflexes with colored LEDs and buttons
- Arduino Uno, p5.js + WebSerial, Tone.js for audio

# Descrption
A reflex-testing game built with Arduino, p5.js (WebSerial) and Tone.js, where players respond to colored LED cues with buttons.
Players see a black “get ready” circle, then one of four cues:
1. **Red**, **Yellow**, or **Green** LED → press the matching physical button.  
2. **RGB** cue → click the canvas with your mouse.
They have a limited time window to respond correctly. Each correct earns a point and speeds up the music & timer, each incorrect press flashes all LEDs, plays an error buzzer, and subtracts a life. After three lives the game ends

## How It Works

- **Arduino**:  
  - Listens on Serial for `GO_RED`, `GO_YELLOW`, `GO_GREEN`, `GO_RGB`, `OFF`, `ALL_ON`, `FAIL`.  
  - Lights the corresponding LED(s).  
  - Reports back `PRESS_RED`, `PRESS_YELLOW`, `PRESS_GREEN` on button presses.

- **p5.js Front-End**:  
  - Uses WebSerial to send commands and receive button events.  
  - Renders the game state (Welcome, Ready, Go, Wrong, Game Over).  
  - Uses Tone.js with two loops chill start screen and driving gameplay—plus a wrong-answer noise.

## Future Development
- Power-ups
- Multiplayer mode
- More Audio Cues
